# Rock-Paper-Scissor-basic-
A fun, interactive Python program that lets you play the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game against the computer. This project demonstrates the use of random number generation, conditional logic, and ASCII art to create a simple yet engaging console-based game.

Features:
User-friendly input prompts to select Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
Randomized computer choice using Python's random.randint() function.
Visual representation of each choice using ASCII art.
Dynamic game logic to determine the winner, loser, or draw based on standard game rules.

Concepts Covered:
Python Lists: Used to store and access ASCII art for each choice.
Conditional Statements: Logic for determining game outcomes.
Randomization: Simulates the computer's choice for unpredictability.
Input Handling: User interaction for seamless gameplay.

How to Run:
Clone the repository or copy the code into your local environment.
Run the Python script using python rock_paper_scissors.py.
Follow the prompts to play the game.

Future Enhancements:
Add support for extended game modes (e.g., best of 3, multiplayer).
Include a scoring system to track wins, losses, and draws.
Improve input validation for a smoother user experience.
